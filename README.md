# HackerNews

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.
Node v16.14.0

# Design choices
## Firebase
Due to unfamiliarity with Firebase, with the main concern of somebody being able to run a Firebase app that belongs to me. I decided to stck with the hacker news REST api.
## Angular
I choose to use Angular as I have more experience with it over REACT.
I left routing out of the App as I knew I was only implementing a front page, routing would need to be added to extend the application.
I used Angualr material modules as I have some past experience with them.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Test Coverage

Run `ng test --code-coverage` to generate code coverage documentation, the coverage folder can be found at the root level of the project directory, e.g /hacker-news/coverage.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You may need to run npm install if there are issues with with dependencies stopping the app running.
